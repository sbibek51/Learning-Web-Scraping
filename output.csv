Basement Room for Rent Kipling and Lakeshore,,"Etobicoke, ON M8V 3G7","March 10, 2024 4:45 PM",,,,,,"I am taking the initiative to help my landlord find a new roomate in the basement of a house near Kipling and Lakeshore.
I speak English and some French, the other tennant speaks Spanish and very little English. I have a preference for someone that is employed and can speak both English and Spanish to help the place run smoothly.
Otherwise you should be able to speak some English to communicate with me and the landlord who speaks English and Mandarin.
The landlord needs someone employed full time and with a credit score above 700. For someone who has just immigrated and not landed a job, a large enough bank balance will do....however that amount wasn't specified.
Each roomate has their own agreement with the landlord so you are only responsible for your own rent.
Street parking only for now and you will need a permit to park between 12-6am. It is easier if you don't have a vehicle.
-Utilities included
-Access to back yard
-Street parking with permit only
